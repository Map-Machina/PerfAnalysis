# ⚠️ DEPRECATED AGENT DIRECTORY

**This agent directory is deprecated and should not be modified.**

## Canonical Location

The single source of truth for all agent definitions is:

```
/agents/
```

Located at the root of the PerfAnalysis repository.

## What To Do

1. **Do NOT modify agents in this directory**
2. **Use agents from `/agents/` at the repository root**
3. **Reference the canonical agent definitions in your workflows**

See `/agents/README.md` for the complete agent directory structure.
