# =============================================================================
# USAGE NOTES
# =============================================================================

usage:
  consulting: |
    Address agents by their role:
    "As the [Agent Name], help me [specific task]."

    Examples:
    - "As the Integration Architect, design the upload workflow."
    - "As the Go Backend Developer, implement /proc/loadavg parsing."
    - "As the Django Tenants Specialist, fix this cross-tenant query leak."

  collaboration: |
    Request multi-agent collaboration for complex tasks:
    "[Agent 1] and [Agent 2]: [collaborative task]."

    Example:
    "Integration Architect and Security Architect: Design the authenticated
     upload API between perfcollector2 and XATbackend."

  routing: |
    Keyword-based routing will automatically select the appropriate agent.
    The manifest routing rules map keywords to agents for quick consultation.
